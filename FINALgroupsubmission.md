### Story Pitch
In June 2025, WMATA introduced the Better Bus Network, its redesign to make the regional bus system faster, more efficient, and better oriented to where today's riders are. Early data indicate the effort has paid off in the form of increased ridership. New, streamlined routes that replaced some of those older, less frequent lines have seen notable upticks in daily passengers in reflection of strong demand for more reliable service.

But there is one important pattern in the data behind the network overhaul: A spatial analysis of bus stop removals pulled from WMATA and U.S. Census data shows that a majority of eliminated stops fell within Southeast Washington, D.C., long a majority minority part of the city. When mapped against the non-Hispanic white population per census tract, it becomes clear that stop reductions disproportionately occurred in tracts with fewer white people.

It raises an important question for policymakers, planners, and residents alike:

How do we balance systemwide efficiency gains with equitable access to transit in all neighborhoods?

The Better Bus Network is a big step in the modernization of transit. Still, its implementation creates repeated consideration of reviewing whether the benefits brought forth by faster and more frequent service come at the cost of reduced accessibility for the communities that rely most on public transit. We can help ensure the next phase of D.C.'s transit evolution is not just more effective but also more equitable by taking a closer look at who is most affected by these changes and where they live.

If we had more time for this project, we would have expanded the work into a fuller narrative centered on both data and lived experience. The expanded story would conclude by examining potential equity-driven solutions such as micro transit options, targeted stop reinstatements, or ongoing equity audits to help ensure future improvements to the transit network benefit communities.
