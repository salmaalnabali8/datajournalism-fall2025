## Assignment 5 - Writing About Data
### Story: [Extreme Heat is One of The Deadliest Consequences of Climate Change](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-extreme-heat-deaths-show-climate-change-risks/)
- Lede: The reporter began this story with an example in the data, citing the severity of the weather conditions in California and how it had experienced the hottest August. They also immediately went into the details and explained how the extreme weather conditions have been disastrous to people's lives. After that, the reporter then uses anectodes and talks about the stories of two individuals who tragically passed away as a result of the extremely hot weather. I think mixing the example from the data with an anectode made this lede very effective at catching the readers' attention while establishing the main goal and content of the report. The anectodes were especially powerful because they added a true human aspect to the story that gained the reader's empathy, something that mere numbers aren't always able to do.  
  
- The data: The analysis itself showed that climate deaths in California are severely undercounted, estimating the true tolls to be six times higher than is measured. At first glance, I am wondering how the reporters were able to tell that each death was due to the extreme weather? They state "mortality data from this period shows that thousands more people died on extremely hot days than would have been typical during milder weather" but if they're just cross-comparing mortality rates with weather, they're not exactly exploring the link. While the findings might be true, there could be many other factors that can explain why mortality levels are higher during those times that are unrelated to the weather conditions.
  
- Sources: The story integrated human sources through interviews with the relatives of people who died as a result of extremely hot weather. They also cited a lot of experts in this specific topic including multiple researchers. They agreed with the claims in the story and emphasized the reporter's argument through their expertise which made the story stronger.
  
- Story structure: I found that this story best fit the martini stucture, starting with the inverted pyramid and then specifically dedicating each section of the story to talk about a different aspect of the main findings. We see this through the break up of the different sections and titles, after it establishes the main findings it goes into "a hidden toll" then "abandoned in the heat"
 then lastly "invisible deaths," which are all different aspects that create the entire story as a whole.

- Numbers: I think the use if numbers in this story was very balanced, I didn't feel like there were parts that made it confusing or boggling and I felt like it was all clear and easy to understand.
  
- Data viz: I think the data visualization enhanced the story and made it easier to understand while emphasizing the main findings. Starting with the scrolly-telling at the beginning and then using multiple graphs and charts throughout was a good way to showcase the data. The first graphic was very good at showcasing the visual data which was more effective at explaining it than just saying it in the story. I also liked the varity of visualizations and that they played around with different ways to show the data. The map at the bottom was also very effective at showcasing the data in a geographic way.
  
- Methods: The author didn't really address many limitations to the data, it was just what the story included. There was a box at the bottom that expanded on the resources they used but not entirely on the nuances surrounding the findings. I think they might've benefitted from more explanation as to how they linked the deaths to the weather. In the story they state: "heat-related deaths are often recorded as heart failure, stroke or respiratory failure" and that there is no clear way they can tell it's because of the heat. I would've liked to see them address that point in a nerd box or deeper in the story itself.

- Other than the point just mentioned about making the link more clear, I don't have any further questions about the story or ways I would've done it differently.
