### Visualization 1: New Year's Resolutions
Original chart link: https://insideoutmastery.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/

New sketch: <img width="1700" height="2200" alt="IMG_3137-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f082629-72d8-407b-bf8c-3d810ab1f244" />

Changes made:
- Created a pie chart because there was two possible answers (yes and no)
- Two pie charts to specifically compare how many young adults make New Year's Resolutions v.s actually achieve them
- Felt like the most relevant piece of information to know
- Two pie charts with the same (yes and no) answer made it easy to compare
   


### Visualization 2: Education Enrollment

New sketch:<img width="1700" height="2200" alt="IMG_3136-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a15e248c-331f-4a59-939f-6271da09ab88" />

Changes made: 
- Used bar chart instead of line because there were too many lines which made it overcrowded and hard to read
- Focused on one specific time frame (2010) because the long span of time made it hard to read
- Bar chart with bigger charts and clearer colors to differentiate between each region
- Clear percentage in order to compare them easily
