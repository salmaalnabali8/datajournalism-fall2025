1. The question I chose to answer is what are the most frequent types of crimes around AU. This is newsworthy to AU's audience because 

2. To answer that question I used a pivot table and added Offense into the Rows section and also in the Values section and set it to Count. It counted how many crimes were committed for each type of offense.
3. The answer was that the most frequent type of offense/crime committed is theft.
## Final Project Data
1. Link to the dataset: [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/metrobus-ridership-stop-grid?utm_source=chatgpt.com](https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/ridership-portal/daily-summary.cfm)
2. Steps I took to clean it were fixing the rows and columns into three columns: Mode, Date, and Ridership
3.  An interesting question I answered was Which mode carries more riders overall in 2024â€“2025? because I thought it would be interesting to see if bus or rail was more popular
4.  In order to find the answer I used Pivot Table and dragged Mode to Rows then Sum of Ridership to Values
5.  I found out that there was more rail ridership than bus.

## Story Research
In terms of WMATA public transport efficiency, there are multiple articles about WMATA's fiscal challenges, including funding shortages that threated the transit system from mid-2024. Some key article I found were https://transitcenter.org/death-spiral-or-new-dawn-how-did-wmata-get-here/ and https://www.wmata.com/about/news/Metro-faces-massive-budget-shortfall.cfm What I didn't find being done was a specific analysis of WMATAs efficiency and how it impacts college students, particularly at American University. I think it would be very interesting and newsworthy to specifically talk about how certain changes in the transit system directly affect students especially in terms of cost, commuter students experience, and its academic impact.
