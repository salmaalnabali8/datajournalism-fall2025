# Assignment 1: [Police in Alaska Article](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/lawless/2019/05/16/lawless-one-in-three-alaska-villages-have-no-local-police/)


### Clarity and Accuracy
The central insight of the article was the awful state of Alaska's public safety and the lack of funding for law enforcement for native communities. It was in the headline but I did not fully understand until I read the first paraghraph. The headline was "Lawless: One in three Alaska villages have no local police," which at first made me assume that it's extremely safe so there's no need for law enforcement to be present until I read more and realized how different the actual story was, which is why I would rate the clarity a 4/5.
 
There was only one form of data visualization, it showed a map of Alaska and red dots on the Alaska communities that had no local law enforcement in 2019. I felt like the visualization was a 4 as well because it was easy to navigate and clearly expressed the central message but I felt like adding multiple forms of visualization would've explained the data further.
 
In terms of accuracy, I would give the data a 5, I think it was very accurate because the sources include people who have firsthand experience, the Native Alaskan population in the city of Anchorage, also the city's main cop Annie Reed gave her personal insight. Additionally, the research is conducted by ProPublica, a highly regarded non-profit committed to investigative journalism and funded by a number of philanthrophic foundations who want to benefit the public. They also use Alaska's official Division of Community and Regional Affair
conduct data and in a differnt article that they have linked, they explain how they did it.


### Quality
I would rate the quality of this article a 4, it was overall very insightful and it is clear that a lot of work was put into it. The thing that made it most valuable was the personal anectodes and experience of cops and civilians in Alaska who this issue affects firsthand. Improvements could be made by adding more data visualization because it felt limited with only one graph.
For both type and color I would give this a 3 because it all looked cohesive and understandable but they didn't really put much effort or thought into the way they employed type and color. Having the dots be red was helpful in making it vibrant and bolding the town of Kiana to emphasize it was also good, otherwise it felt pretty bland.


### Creativity
I would rate the piece a 4 on creativity because it included multiple images of the relevant subjects, specifically the main police officer being interviewed in the story Annie Reed and other visuals of the population and city. It helped by giving faces to the subjects of the story and adding some creativity but it also wasn't essential in explaining the central insight. 



##  Short Pitch
I want to research how the price of coffee is influenced by political and economic factors such as inflation and tarrifs, especially in the current political climate which is very unstable and hectic currently. I feel like not many people care about politics unless it personally affects them and the average American is not up to date on all political and economic news. Coffee is something very simple and trivial but is still one thing that most if not all people have in common, everyone drinks coffee. Showing the relationship between those two things can simplify large concepts to people and show how detrimental the impacts of changes in the economic and political state have on people's everyday lives, something as simple as the price of their daily morning coffee. I would compile data through cross-examining menus of different coffee shops through the years and see the price differences. I could also interview coffee shop owners and regular customers to get different perspectives of people who are impacted by this directly.
